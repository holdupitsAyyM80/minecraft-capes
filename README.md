minecraft capes for base-edits/hacked clients

currently for 1.8

you can add multiple usernames + image links

there is two ways of doing this:

1) Add the Capes class to your src and then modify the SkinManager class with the one here
or
2) [requires optifine] replace CapeUtils class with one here.
