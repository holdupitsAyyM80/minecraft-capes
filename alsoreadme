if you want method 1 to work properly (for you + others), you need to switch the link
make it a dropbox thing or a direct link to where you will host this
must be a .json file
to actually do it, copy the stuff from my link into the .json file
change out my username with yours and then change the link to the image
to actually add people, on the next line, add this (inside the {}):

"username": "link"

change the username to the player's actual username, and the link to a direct link to an image
(imgur is best tbh)

and then boom it works
